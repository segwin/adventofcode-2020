# Advent of Code 2020

These are my solutions for each day of the [Advent of Code 2020 event](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

## Running the solutions

To run these, you must have Go 1.13+ installed. You can build the app with the following command:

```bash
go build . -o aoc
```

To run a given day (e.g. day 5):

```bash
$ ./aoc day5

PART 1
  RESULT: Highest seat ID is 953

PART 2
  RESULT: My seat ID is 615
```
